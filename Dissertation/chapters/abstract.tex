Reasoning about timing and energy properties of programs for embedded systems is often useful due to the limited resources, or strict timing requirements, of these. In this dissertation, we present and evaluate a framework, based on existing work by the \textsc{TeamPlay} \cite{teamplay:d1.1} project, for modelling and proving time and energy properties of low-level C programs using Domain Specific Languages, dependent types, the \Idris programming language and its built-in proof system. We also provide a small collection of programs and models to showcase the power of the framework.
