This project extends and evaluates work done by the \textsc{TeamPlay} \cite{teamplay:d1.1} project in terms of constructing a framework for reasoning about extra-functional properties of programs designed for embedded systems. The framework presented works by annotating existing C code, measuring the compiled code on hardware to get timing and energy data, using the collected data in combination with the annotated code to create a model in an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) based in the \Idris programming language, and then uses \Idris's built-in proof system to create a certificate that the specified properties do or do not hold. As part of the evaluation, this project presents a collection of programs and models to demonstrate the correctness and usefulness of the framework.
