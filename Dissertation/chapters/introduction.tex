\begin{itemize}
	\item embedded systems are increasingly common, the IoT
	\item e.g. wireless handsets, smart cards, routers, scientific sensors,
		  health services, satellites, etc.
	\item these often require small footprints in terms of CPU cycles/time and
		  energy as they have limited resources
	\item being able to reason about how much time and energy a part of a
		  program takes is useful for these
	\item even better if guarantees could be made
	\item using an EDSL and Idris' proof system, obtain something which allows
		  us to reason about these and to provide ``contracts'' which prove that
		  the desired properties hold.
