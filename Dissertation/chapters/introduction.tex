	\item being able to reason about how much time and energy a part of a

Embedded systems are becoming increasingly common. From wireless handsets, smart cards, and routers to scientific sensors, health monitors, and satellites, embedded systems constitute more and more of our daily lives, and control more and more essential parts of it. With more devices connected to the internet than people since approximately 2009 and an estimated 50 billion connected devices by 2020 \cite{cisco-whitepaper}, there is an increasing need to provide certain guarantees for these systems. Since embedded systems often have limited resources, e.g. battery or processing power, being able to reason about how much time and energy programs take would be very useful for the programmers of embedded systems. Based on existing work by the TEAMPLAY project \cite{teamplay:d1.1} this project explores the ability to express and prove timing and energy properties using an Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) and the Idris programming language \cite{brady_2013}
