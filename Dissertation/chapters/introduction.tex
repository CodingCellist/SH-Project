\begin{itemize}
	\item security is an ever increasing concern
	\item side channel attacks are very hard to guard against
	\item hard to write secure, low-level programs
	\item hard to \textit{guarantee} that a program is secure
	\item mention correctness by construction \cite{Chapman:2006:CCM:1151816.1151820}?
	\item introduce a EDSL for C which uses Idris' proof system to prove
		  correctness of safety properties
\end{itemize}
