Embedded systems are becoming increasingly common. From wireless handsets, smart cards, and routers to scientific sensors, health monitors, and satellites, embedded systems are an increasing part of our daily lives, and control more and more essential parts of it. With more devices connected to the internet than people since approximately 2009 and an estimated 50 billion connected devices by 2020 \cite{cisco-whitepaper}, there is an increasing need to provide certain guarantees for these systems. Since embedded systems often have limited resources, e.g. battery or processing power, being able to reason about how much time and energy programs take would be very useful for the programmers of embedded systems. One way to reason about these are [Embedded] Domain Specific Languages ([E]DSLs).\\\par

A DSL is a programming language which is designed for a specific purpose. The theoretical benefit to these is that the programmer will be able to much quicker develop the program they want, using the DSL, than they would using a general purpose language \cite{685738}. However, since designing a language is difficult and time-consuming building a language \textit{on top of} another language allows us to borrow constructs from the ``host'' language (e.g. operators, variable declarations) and use them in our DSL, thereby speeding up its development \cite{hudak1996building}.\\\par

DSLs can be used for various purposes. From network protocols \cite{5158855} to concurrency or systems programming \cite{brady2010correct,10.1007/978-3-642-27694-1_18}. Using \Idris as the host language for an EDSL means that the resulting DSL are well-typed and that properties can be proven to be correct thanks to the underlying, built-in proof system based on \textsc{Ivor} \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-74130-5_9,brady_2013}. Based on existing work by the \textsc{TeamPlay} project \cite{teamplay:d1.1} this project explores the ability to express and prove timing and energy properties using an EDSL and the \Idris programming language \cite{brady_2013}.
