\begin{itemize}
    \item framework successfully completed (full set of operators)
    \item C programs in the framework can be turned into \Idris models...
    \item ...which show all operators work as intended
    \item TeamPlay annotations non-disruptively integrate with C code
    \item annotations are easy to read
    \item programs can be modelled {[so far only have one...]}
    \item FURTHER WORK: compiler, open-ended assertions, more complicated
          programs, ...
\end{itemize}
\todo{conclusion based on these}
