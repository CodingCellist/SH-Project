\begin{itemize}
	\item explain Idris \texttt{Nat} numbers (i.e. \texttt{Z} and \texttt{S})?
	\item explain \texttt{Dec}?
	\item TEAMPLAY \texttt{blocks}, \texttt{blockenergy}, \texttt{blocktime},
		  etc?
	\item \texttt{Eq} was already implemented (using `native' things),
		  \texttt{NEq} was more complicated (different ways \texttt{Nat}s can be
		  not equal)
	\item explain how only \texttt{LTE} is required for that selection of
		  operators?
	\item \texttt{And} was already implemented with custom types, used this as
		  inspiration for implementation of \texttt{Or}
	\item explain how these `building blocks'/operators go together (similar to
		  a stack-based language)
\end{itemize}
