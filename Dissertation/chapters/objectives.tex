\section{Primary}
    The primary objectives of this project are to design a formal framework for assumptions about extra-functional properties of programs, write basic C programs which capture that the operators in the framework function as intended, come up with simple real C programs which use the framework, and to evaluate how good the \textsc{TeamPlay} project's existing framework is for these purposes.


\section{Secondary}
    The secondary objectives of this project are to write more interesting C programs which use the framework and come up with a collection of programs which showcase the framework.


\section{Ternary}
    The ternary objectives for this project are to explore more advanced coding concepts like nested \texttt{for} loops, to automate the translation from C code to the framework, and to support open-ended assertions.
