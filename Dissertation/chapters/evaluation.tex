I initially made sure the basic operators worked. Once this was done, more
complicated examples were created using the operators.
\section{Operators}
	Several examples were constructed to evaluate whether the operators worked
	as intended. There are essentially three cases which need to be covered:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \texttt{Z} (i.e 0), as this is the base case for all \texttt{Nat}s
		\item \texttt{S Z} (i.e 1), as it is the immediate successor of 0
		\item \texttt{(S ... (S Z)..)} (i.e. numbers greater than 1), as they
			  demonstrate that the recursion works.
	\end{enumerate}
