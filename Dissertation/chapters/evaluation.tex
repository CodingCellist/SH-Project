In order to be able to use the existing operators, and the ones I had implemented, in code, I needed to make sure that they worked, i.e. that they did not return anything unexpected (e.g., \texttt{Eq} should not evaluate to true for 1 and 3, and \texttt{And False False} should not evaluate to \texttt{True}). This is the purpose of the first section (\ref{evaln:ops}) of this chapter. With working operators, it should then be possible to construct slightly more complex C programs, and annotate and model them using the framework.


\section{Operators}\label{evaln:ops}
    \todo{rewrite this}
	Several examples were constructed to evaluate whether the operators worked
	as intended. There were three cases which needed to be covered:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \idrisinline{Z} (i.e 0), as this is the base case for all
			  \texttt{Nat}s
		\item \idrisinline{S Z} (i.e 1), as it is the immediate successor of 0
		\item \idrisinline{(S ... (S Z)..)} (i.e. numbers greater than 1), as they
			  demonstrate that the recursion works.
	\end{enumerate}
	For each of the numeric operators, I wrote examples based on relationships between 0, 1, and 3. I then used the numeric operators to define two simple statements, one which was true and a one which was false, and used these to evaluate the boolean operators.
