I initially made sure the basic operators worked. Once this was done, more
complicated examples were created using the operators.
\section{Operators}
	Several examples were constructed to evaluate whether the operators worked
	as intended. There were three cases which needed to be covered:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \idrisinline{Z} (i.e 0), as this is the base case for all
			  \texttt{Nat}s
		\item \idrisinline{S Z} (i.e 1), as it is the immediate successor of 0
		\item \idrisinline{(S ... (S Z)..)} (i.e. numbers greater than 1), as they
			  demonstrate that the recursion works.
	\end{enumerate}
	For each of the numeric operators, I wrote examples based on relationships between 0, 1, and 3. I then used the numeric operators to define two simple statements, one which was true and a one which was false, and used these to evaluate the boolean operators.
