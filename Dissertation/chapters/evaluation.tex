In order to be able to use the existing operators, and the ones I had implemented, in code, I needed to make sure that they worked, i.e. that they did not return anything unexpected (e.g., \texttt{Eq} should not evaluate to true for 1 and 3, and \texttt{And False False} should not evaluate to \texttt{True}). This is the described in the first section (\ref{evaln:ops}) of this chapter. With working operators, it should then be possible to construct slightly more complex C programs, and annotate and model them using the framework. This is described in the second section (\ref{evaln:progs}).


\section{Operators}\label{evaln:ops}
    In order to evaluate the operators, I constructed multiple examples which tested specific input cases/categories and asserted that they functioned as expected in each case. For numeric operators, I tested the following input cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item zero and zero -- they form the base case of natural numbers so for
              all recursive operations to be correct, the base case has to be correct
        \item zero and one or one and zero -- since one is the immediate
              successor of zero, there is only the need for one recursive step,
              so if this case works, adding more recursive steps is likely to 
              work
        \item numbers greater than zero and one -- these require multiple 
              recursive steps and so if they work, all numbers should work as
              we then know that recursion works
    \end{itemize}

    For boolean operators, I tested the possible combinations of \texttt{True} and \texttt{False} for the operator and compared the results with the corresponding truth-table for the corresponding logical-operator.
