An example of a real-world use-case would be to assert that encrypting something using the AES encryption method does not require more than a set amount of energy. This could be to guarantee that the encryption will not heavily impact the embedded device's battery life. For this, I used an implementation of AES written in C \cite{c_aes}. The parts of the code which would be interesting to annotate and assert are the parts that do the AES cipher encryption:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The part of the AES encryption cipher we are interested in: the rounds}, escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
(*\vdots*)
add_round_key(state, w, 0);

for (r = 1; r < Nr; r++) {
    sub_bytes(state);
    shift_rows(state);
    mix_columns(state);
    add_round_key(state, w, r);
}

sub_bytes(state);
shift_rows(state);
add_round_key(state, w, Nr);
(*\vdots*)
\end{lstlisting}

This example will evolve throughout this dissertation, as more parts of the project are presented and explained.
