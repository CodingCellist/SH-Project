I would like to thank my supervisors at the School of Computer Science for their help and guidance with the project. Specifically, I would like to thank Dr. Edwin Brady for lending me a copy of his book on \Idris and helping me understand the details of the language, and Dr.s Chris Brown and Adam Barwell for their patience and help with introducing me to the \textsc{TeamPlay} project. I would also like to thank all the members of the \textsc{TeamPlay} project for allowing me to attend their research seminar in St Andrews.
