    A correct C program asserting the vice-versa of the example in Section \ref{evaln:ops:eq}, Listing \ref{evaln:ops:eq-0-1}.
    
    \idrisinput{"../Idris_Stuff/Examples/Eq/Eq_1_0.idr"}
    The resulting model `\texttt{eq\_1\_0}' consists of an assertion `\texttt{eq\_1\_0\_assert}' and nothing more. This assertion contains the literals 1 and 0 (assigned to \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} respectively), their evaluation (\texttt{x'} and \texttt{y'}), and a decidable proof of whether they are equal.

    \lstinputlisting{"../Idris_Stuff/Examples/Eq/Eq_3_1.c"}
    
    A valid C program which asserts that if we swap the operands of Listing \ref{evaln:ops:eq-1-3}, then the equality should not hold.
    
    \idrisinput{"../Idris_Stuff/Examples/Eq/Eq_3_1.idr"}
    
    The resulting model has the literals swapped, but apart from that it is identical to the model for Listing \ref{evaln:ops:eq-1-3}.
