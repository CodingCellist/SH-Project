    A simple program asserting the vice-versa of the \texttt{Eq\_0\_1} example in Section \ref{evaln:ops:eq}.

    The resulting model `\texttt{eq\_1\_0}' consists of an assertion `\texttt{eq\_1\_0\_assert}' and nothing more. This assertion contains the literals 1 and 0 (assigned to \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} respectively), their evaluation (\texttt{x'} and \texttt{y'}), and a decidable proof of whether they are equal.
